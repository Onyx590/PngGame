# PngGame
What is being created here is a Pong Game clone using Windows API. 
This will be an improvement over my tetris game in a one or two ways. 
  
  For one, the window will be resizable, which means that the game will not be distorted when you resize the window (that's good). 
  Also, This will not necessarily be a command line interface game.

  So all this are some good stuff coming to this game. 
  Hopefully I finish it on schedule.
